# Capstone-2
capstone project about the national parks

So, this project was something, but in the end, its done.
first things first, we have the index page, which acts as a home page. This has some basic info about this website and links to the other pages.
we then have mountain select, which lets you select a mountain which it will then display the information, we also have just mountain which shows a numbered list of them all.
lastly, we have search which lets you search for parks by state which it will then show like mountain select. just remember, Ohio isnt real.
